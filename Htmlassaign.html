        <h3> History</h3>

        In 1980, physicist <span style="color: Blue">Tim Berners-Lee</span>, a
        contractor at<b>CERN</b>, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
        CERN researchers to use and share documents. In <b>1989</b>,
        <em>Berners-Lee</em> wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server
        software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
        engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding,
        but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes
        of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext
        is used"; an <span style="color: green"><i>encyclopedia</i></span> is
        the first entry.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called
        <span style="color: brown"><i>"HTML Tags"</i></span
        >,[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
        1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
        influenced by <a href="CERN_SGML"> CERN SGML</a>, an in-house Standard
        <a href="Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">
          Markup Language (SGML)</a
        >
        -based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still
        exist in HTML 4.

            <p>
                <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/front-end-development"> Front-End Development </a> is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact with: the user interface (UI).
                 Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, often working closely with design and UX teams 
                 to capture both the intended look and feel of the site, while also creating a quality user experience across multiple 
                 device type

            <li>Back-End Development</li>
            <p><a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/back-end-development">Back-End Development</a> responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see. This is also known as server-side development 
                because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes logic, APIs and database interactions that power
                 the site</p>

                    <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/full-stack-developer-skills" target="_blank">Full-Stack Development</a>  is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible for the site or app take care of the entire development stack,
                     from the inner workings typically performed on the back-end to the presentation layer normally handled by front-end developers.

      <h3>Top 5 uses of HTML </h3>
      <p>As said by many, HTML projects boost our profile and ensure a bright career ahead. 
        It is essential to know the various applications of HTML in this regard. 
        We could list down a lot of uses of HTML, let us dive deeper into a few essential ones.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Web Pages Development</li>
        <p>Different websites we see on the internet regularly are in some form written in HTML code. 
            As mentioned earlier HTML is used to structure the web page in various ways. We could include different sections, 
            insert tables, and split the web page. With the introduction of Semantic HTML elements in HTML5, 
            HTML has made hassle free even for the developer to understand and modify his/her code better. </p>

        <li>Navigating the Internet</li>
        <p>HTML is an essential element in navigating between web pages. Navigation is possible using the hypertext concept. 
            The linking is also simpler. From the internet user's point of view, they click on a text which takes them to the next page.
             HTML facilitates navigation by hyperlinking with the help of an anchor tag.</p>
        <li>Responsive Designs</li>
        <p>The integral part of a web page is for it to be interactive and responsive to the user.
             HTML makes it possible. Unlike static pages, responsive ones also have a better reach. 
             Automatically resizing, hiding, shrinking, or enlarging a website to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones) 
             is what a responsive web design is made of where HTML and CSS aid the purpose. </p>
        <li>Storage Function in the Browser</li>
        <p>Storage of data in the browser was tedious in the past. For a user to save the data of the browser that persists between two sessions,
            the user's cookies or infrastructure is to be built from the server end. This process has now been eased with HTML5.
            <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html5/">HTML5</a> has roped in new features. Such storage features are localStorage and IndexDB.  
        </p>
        <li>Data Entry Support</li>
        <p>With many other features that we have been discussing, here's another important one to be taken into account 
            which is data entry. For so long we have stored data in dedicated files for this purpose. HTML5 paves way for data entry online, 
            that is to obtain the data to store, from the user via forms. In this case, we have HTML tags like
             <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-forms/" >form</a></p>
