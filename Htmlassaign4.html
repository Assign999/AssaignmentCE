            <p>
              I am a passionate <strong>UI/UX Developer</strong> with a strong
              focus on creating intuitive, engaging, and accessible user
              experiences. With a solid foundation in both design principles and
              front-end development, I specialize in translating user needs into
              visually appealing and highly functional web applications. My
              expertise includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and
              responsive design frameworks, combined with a deep understanding
              of user-centered design, wireframing, prototyping, and usability
              testing. I collaborate closely with product managers, designers,
              and backend developers to ensure seamless integration of UI
              components and deliver polished end-to-end user interfaces. My
              goal is always to balance aesthetics with usability, optimizing
              workflows and enhancing overall user satisfaction. I stay up to
              date with the latest trends in design systems, accessibility
              standards, and performance optimization to ensure modern,
              scalable, and inclusive digital experiences.
